#React Prop Drilling Example
This repository demonstrates the concept of prop drilling in React, passing data from a parent component to nested child components.

#Structure
App Component
The App component serves as the top-level parent component. It holds the state for the count value and the increaseValue function.

Home Component
The Home component is a child of App. It receives the count and increaseValue function as props from App. It further drills down the count prop to its child component Operation.

Operation Component
The Operation component resides within Home. It receives the count prop from Home. It displays the count value and provides a button to trigger the increaseValue function, thereby updating the count.

Props Passed
App to Home
count: An integer representing the current count value.
increaseValue: A function to increment the count value.
Home to Operation
count: The count value passed down from the App component.
